In the Section 5 Activities Folder, there is a folder called 5-Homework that contains two files: index.html and styles.css.

The index.html file is a site about Andre the Giant while the styles.css file contains pre-existing styling for the site. Copy the contents of the files linked above into their respective files you created for the "Andre-The-Giant" folder and then do the following:

In the styles.css file, fix the styling for the site, and create a media query that fixes the site to correctly display on the "iPhone 6/7/8" view in DevTools.

Focus on the following:

The #bio <ul> at the top of the page
<img> tags
<div> tags
links
TIP: In order to make sure your media query is functioning properly (i.e, the query triggers when expected), set up a simple css property inside your media query that changes the background color to blue before you attempt to fix the styling. Use your dev tools in the browser to confirm that the background changes to blue when expected (iPhone 6/7/8 view) and THEN start working on the fixes. Don't forget to remove the background color property you made to test your media query!
